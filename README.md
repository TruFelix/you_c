# Idea
In order to not keep putting off your own promises (`Contracts`)
you have to clear all successfully done Contracts, if you fail to fulfill one.

Because you have already accumulated some contracts, you want to avoid that,
also, because they represent that you did some work you would'nt want to throw that
symbol of pride away, would you?
